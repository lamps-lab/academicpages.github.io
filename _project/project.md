Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely used tool to extract textual information from the scanned documents. Extracting metadata and full scanned ETD segmentation needs a proper OCR technique. Although many state-of-the-art open access tools exhibit satisfactory performance with certain types of documetns, experiments indicate that they tend to produce unnacceptable errors or fail for scanned ETDs. Extracting metadata and full text segmentation from scanned ETDs are challenging due to poor image resolution, imperfections with OCR techniques, and typewritten text. We have experimented three OCR technology on scanned ETDs and results shows one outperforms than another. We have experimented the following OCR technologies for this project.

**Tesseract OCR**

**Google Cloud API**

**Clova OCR**
