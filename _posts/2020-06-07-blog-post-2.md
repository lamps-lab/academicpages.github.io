In the previous blog, I have discussed how tesseract-OCR performed on scanned Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). If you have read my earlier blog, we already saw that the process started with converting the cover page of scanned ETDs into images. Then, tesseract-OCR was applied and saved the extracted result into text files. We also saw that OpenCV OCR failed on scanned ETDs. We could try a widely used open-source tool such as GROBID, designed for scholarly papers. However, this article shows that GROBID is intended for extracting bibliographic metadata for born-digital academic papers. Finally, we decided to apply tesseract-OCR to extract the text from the cover page of scanned ETDs. Afterward, a series of regular expressions (RegEx) was performed to extract seven metadata fields, including titles, authors, academic-programs, institutions, advisors, and years. In this blog, I will introduce how RegEx can be a powerful tool to quickly parse the text with patterns.<a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2020/06/2020-06-07-regular-expression-powerful.html"> Read More..</a>
